# ECommerce Automation
The approach adopted in this project involves subdividing the modules and organizing them in a structure similar to that of the application under test. Additionally, test data is stored separately from the script, simplifying maintenance.

Regarding the Page Object Repository, the design pattern chosen is the Page Object Model (POM).
